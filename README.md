# Potholes Bangalore

### An Application to Track Millions if not Billons of Potholes in Bangalore.

Potholes are very dangerous, every other day our residents are dying in 
road(if you can call them that) accidents, our backs are pretty much 
fucked. Not a single road is free of potholes.

Application aims to track potholes in and around bangalore.

### Features
- [ ] User Should be able to Login and create account.
- [ ] Lightweight Mobile Yolo Model to detect if uploaded picture is of a Pothole and not a Dick Pic.
- [ ] For every successful pothole picture, user gets a pothole coin(number of pothole coins would define user credibility).
- [ ] Geo Tagging For the Picture, to generate live stats.
- [ ] Affirmation from user if the location is right, if not correct it.

### Tech Stack
A simple architecture consists of a [boiler-plate code](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate) 
in Django and React. The code is to be deployed on EC2 and S3 will be used to
store pothole images.
